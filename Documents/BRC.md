##Notes
Current Solution
- Slightly different order books are sent out weekly and monthly. The full order book is sent once per month, while a two week view (is this correct?) is sent out every week.
- This task was previously carried out by two full-time dedicated employees, but is now done via the Order Book application maintained by John Orange. This application takes the form of an Excel macro. The Order Book is run every Thursday morning, and the supplier is expected to respond by Monday lunchtime.
- The Order Book doesn't run on its own and it frequently breaks for reasons that aren't always clear, meaning the activity has to be done manually which can take up to 2 days; as a result the supplier may not have sufficient time to respond by the Monday lunchtime deadline.
- An alternative tool (Supplier Portal) exists but isn't used because it's not fully fit for purpose - it doesn't notify planners of changes to delivery dates.
- Suppliers typically send the order books back to the same email address they received it from. If that buyer isn't in, the other buyers can't get access to the returned order books in their inbox. A shared Supply Chain inbox has already been requested to resolve this issue.
- Some indirect suppliers are handled separately or in a different way - not via this application? (more information required)
- To give an idea of potential user base, there are about 4 direct buyers at Plymouth, while there are as many as 40 joint buyer-planners at Wolverhampton.

Ubiquitious Language
- Delivery Management Tool - the proposed solution.
- Order Book
- OTIF - On-Time In Full
- Supplier Portal - an externally-developed alternative solution introduced with SAP integration ~2 years ago, now bypassed or not used because it is not fully fit for purpose; this system is unsuitable because it doesn't notify planners of changes to delivery dates. Note that this system is used for IMU02 only; the reason for this is unclear.
- ZLTA - Long-Term Agreement
