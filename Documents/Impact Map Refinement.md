# **Impact Map Refinement**

## Introduction
Assess any [impact map](http://ggbpla0i:3638/sites/DevOpsProjects/Delivery%20Management%20Tool/Shared%20Documents/SupplyChain_ImpactMap.xmind) (rev 1.2) deltas with business stakeholders to assess legitmacy for requirement inclusion.

After an internal discussion, the development team decided not to hold an impact map refinement meeting as business and user expectations are fundamentally aligned and have therefore proceeded to storyboarding.
