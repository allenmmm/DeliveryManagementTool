## Notes
- **FULL** Order Book refers to ALL the planned deliveries in the future. There is no finite window of time.
- **REDUCED** Order Book (A.K.A. a partial order book) refers to a period of 3 months; this can be set in the backend, but it might still be useful to have the flexibility of a freeform date input.
- **MAJOR SUPPLIER** (who receive FULL Order Book on first week of month, then a condensed or shortened version on subsequent weeks due to quantity of orders from this supplier) - change of terminology on this check box to **REDUCED ORDER BOOK**; this is because every supplier is major or important to the buyers. There are only three suppliers in this category so it might not be worth it having an input. It could just be an option in the backend? TBD
- No one knows what the Z in **ZLTA** stands for; Kim Legg says she will find out.
- On the Manage Suppliers page, it might be useful to have the option to deactivate or park a supplier (rather than delete them)
- Attendees mentioned they particularly liked 1) the ability to assign multiple buyers to a single supplier, 2) the idea of automatically validating the email and pinging back Order Books that include invalid responses

## Conclusion
- All attendees confirmed the storyboard is aligned with expectations.
